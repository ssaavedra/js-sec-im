This is a roadmap or a list of things that should be done.


Primordial
==========

 * Make it funcional
 * Let users exchange their keys within the program (we can allow now our own approach if it is easier)

Important
=========
 * Code a layer for exchanging keys and later on the messages.
 * Warn if a message can't be encoded.

To do later on
==============
 * Code a mechanism to import/export keys using PEM-encoded values, ultimately using ASN-1 in order to offer OpenSSL compatibility.
 * Test various encoding methods and use the better one for a browser.
 * Use a key exchange to use symmetric encryption for each session.
